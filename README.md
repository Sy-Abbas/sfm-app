# sfm-app
 This GitHub repository contains the code for the Surplus Food Management (SFM) app, which is a versatile application designed to tackle the increasing problem of food wastage. The SFM app offers an innovative solution that connects local businesses and food banks to redistribute surplus food and reduce waste. This repository will be continuously updated since I am still working on this project.
