### Description:
Food waste is an ongoing issue in our society that we have failed to address appropriately. There is the possibility of waste at every stage of food usage, from harvesting and transportation through storage and consumption. Surplus food is often a major contributor to this problem; while it is still safe to eat, it is no longer in use. This dilemma occurs regularly in hotels and restaurants: continually aiming for client pleasure often drives enterprises to produce more than they need. The investigations revealed that food waste does not just deplete energy and water resources it also causes dirt to become more polluted due to the climate's accumulation of dangerous substances. According to studies, food waste also boosts ozone-depleting chemical emissions as natural garbage deteriorates and emits methane into the atmosphere. Furthermore, food waste destroys the natural environment since food production necessitates vast amounts of land and resources. As a result, the biodiversity of the climate is jeopardised, which has an impact on the climate. Overall, excess food waste substantially impacts the climate, and it is vital to reduce food waste to protect the climate and mitigate its negative effects.<br>
According to the literature review findings, various difficulties confront food waste solutions, reducing their efficacy in tackling the issue. These roadblocks include issues with transportation, coordination, and gratification. Most crucially, several existing solutions rely on motivated volunteers who have reliable vehicles and understand how to handle foods securely during storage and travel. The present solutions for coping with excess food have a number of challenges that limit their effectiveness. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective techniques for overcoming these obstacles while reducing food waste. As a result of this research conducted, it has been determined that distributing surplus food using mobile applications is one of the best ways to deal with this problem. SFM app plans to address this problem most effectively.<br>
The SFM application provides a practical solution to the growing problem of food waste and insecurity in our society. The application streamlines the process of redistributing surplus food from high-end restaurants to NGOs, who can then distribute it to those in need. The SFM app is designed for two users: donors and NGOs. Users can view other users' listings and add their own listings. The application also has a profile page where users may amend their personal information, a feedback page where users can submit comments, a recent chat page, a chat page, and a privacy policy page. The recent chat page also organises all types of chats, whilst the chat page is used for direct user communication. The SFM team has efficiently incorporated the testing and validation checks during the development phase, resulting in an intuitive mobile platform that effectively addresses food waste and inadequate sustenance issues globally. The SFM team has also outlined several future plans, including adding an admin user and cloud notifications and optimising the nearby tab and chat pages. These improvements will undoubtedly enhance the user experience and further improve the application's efficiency in tackling the issue of food waste and insecurity.<br>
In conclusion, food waste is a huge issue in our culture that affects both the environment and food insecurity. While there are countless solutions, their usefulness is limited by multiple hurdles. The SFM smartphone application, on the other hand, provides a practical answer to this problem by expediting the process of dispersing extra food to those in need. The SFM app, with its user-friendly layout and unique features, provides an effective platform for donors and NGOs to communicate, contributing to global food waste reduction and food security. The SFM team is poised to significantly address this issue and encourage sustainable food practices by continually enhancing and upgrading the application.<br>
